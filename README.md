THE_ODIN_PROJECT : ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS GAME

Project 2 of the Foundations Course (JavaScript Part)

Objective : Update of first rock-paper-scissors.

In this one, use of DOM manipulation.

What's done : 
1. Player choose their hand.
2. Display result once the game is on.
3. Until one of the player has a score of 5 ==> is declared the winner

What I want to improve later:
1. Appearance
2. 5 rounds max, game is over and shoud be reinitialised + asking if player want to play again.
3. Text result should be permanent.
